# Niajiri CV Building Assistant - Improvements Documentation

## Overview of Improvements

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Niajiri CV Building Assistant to address session data synchronization issues and enhance the CV generation quality.

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### 1. Centralized Session Management

**Problem Solved**: Previously, different components (progress tracker, chat interface, streamlit app) were managing session data independently, leading to synchronization issues where progress wasn't reflecting actual CV data.

**Solution**: Created a centralized `SessionManager` class that serves as the single source of truth for all session data.

**Key Files**:
- `utils/session_manager.py` - New centralized session management
- `ui/components/progress_tracker.py` - Updated to use session manager
- `ui/components/chat_interface.py` - Updated to use session manager
- `ui/streamlit_app.py` - Updated to use session manager

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Progress tracking now accurately reflects CV completion
- ✅ All components work with the same data
- ✅ No more data inconsistencies between chat and progress
- ✅ Automatic synchronization across all UI components

### 2. Professional PDF Generation System

**Problem Solved**: The original PDF generation was basic and incomplete, missing several CV sections and having poor visual design.

**Solution**: Created a comprehensive PDF generation service with multiple professional templates.

**Key Files**:
- `services/pdf_generator.py` - New professional PDF generation system

**New Features**:
- 📄 **Modern Template**: Clean, contemporary design with accent colors
- 📋 **Classic Template**: Traditional, formal design for conservative industries  
- 📝 **Minimal Template**: Ultra-clean, distraction-free design
